_algorithms_ - heart and soul of computing
- math theory meets practice

programming != algorithmic problem solving

Dijkstra - "CS : computers :: astronomy : telescopes"

homework:  typeset, PDF @ handin.cs.clemson.edu
- due before class
- 35% of final grade

quizzes:
- 2 of
- 2 * 20%

final:
- 25%

collaborators should be listed
- individual write up

Proofs:  must be convincing
- level of detail is _undefined_

Don't look up solutions from previous semesters

_A Good Algorithm_
- always terminates
- _correct_ output
- "close enough" sometimes fine
- randomized alg fail, small probability
