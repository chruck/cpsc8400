__algorithms__ - heart and soul of computing
- math theory meets practice

programming != algorithmic problem solving

homework:  typeset, PDF @ handin.cs.clemson.edu
- due before class
- 35% of final grade

quizzes:
- 2 of
- 2 * 20%

final:
- 25%

collaborators should be listed
- individual write up

Proofs:  must be convincing
- level of detail is __undefined__

Don't look up solutions from previous semesters

### A Good Algorithm
- always terminates
- __correct__ output
- "close enough" sometimes fine
- randomized alg fail, small probability

- __efficient__
  - fast (time)  &larr; most
  - memory
  - bandwidth
  - power/head used

- __simple__:  "elegant" to describe, understand, analyze
  - debug

"step" -N - what is it?
  operation
